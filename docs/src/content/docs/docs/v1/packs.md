title: Packs
---

There is one built-in core pack with basic cards, a dice and chips. See `app/pack` for reference. For creating your own pack, mirror the setup, change to your liking and create a zip directory (make sure there is no extra folder in there). Change the file extension to `.qka` and you are ready to share it.
To import it, open the app and go to `Packs`. Then click on the import button in the top right corner.
