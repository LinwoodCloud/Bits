> Welcome to Quokka, the opensource table sandbox game.

Quokka is a game table sandbox that is aiming for unified experience across all platforms. It provides simple UI with powerful customization.

## Getting started

> You can use the sidebar to navigate quickly through the wiki.

To start working on the game you have two options:

1. [Downloads](/downloads) the game version that is appropriate for your platform (Quokka can run on most mobile, desktop, and web platforms).
2. Use [web version](https://web.quokka.linwood.dev) if you cannot find your platform or if you don't want to install it on it.

> Once you open the game, continue reading.

## Docs are in working

The game is very new. I'm currently mainly focussing on developing the game.
Feel free to create a pull request on github to expand the docs.

If you have questions, don't hestitate to visit [the discord server](https://linwood.dev/discord), [the matrix server](https://linwood.dev/matrix) or [the github discussion page](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Quokka/discussions).
