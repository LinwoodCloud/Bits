## Principles

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Cross platform" icon="laptop">
		You can use the app on your phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop. The app is available on Linux, Android, and Windows. You can also use the app on the web.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Multiplayer and offline" icon="puzzle">
		Play games with your friends or alone. You can also play offline. The app is designed to work without an internet connection even in multiplayer mode.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Customizable" icon="pencil">
		Create custom cards, boards, and dice. You can also create custom rules with lua (coming soon). Configure everything inside the app.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Sandbox" icon="open-book">
		The app is a sandbox game. No predefined rules are implemented yet. You can play without rules or load custom rules from a pack.
